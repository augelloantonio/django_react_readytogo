# Django + React Starter Project

This is a ready to use starter project using Django as backend and React as frontend.
It aims to provide a minimal full-stack setup where React is built into Djangoâ€™s static files folder for easy deployment.

The project is ideal for developers who have some knowledge of Django and React and want to explore how these technologies can be combined.

```

---

## Backend Setup (Django)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - Windows (CMD):
     ```cmd
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```

4. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser for admin access:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

---

## Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the React app directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend/app
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in `frontend/app` with the following content to specify the React build output folder:

   ```env
   BUILD_PATH=../../backend/assets
   ```

4. Build the React app for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. (Optional) If you encounter build issues, clean dependencies and reinstall:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

---

## Development Workflow

- **Run Django backend server**

  From the `backend` directory (with virtualenv activated):

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

  This will serve Django at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

- **Run React development server**

  From the `frontend/app` directory:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  React will serve your frontend with hot reload at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- **Notes:**

  - During development, run both servers concurrently in separate terminals.
  - Configure React to proxy API requests to Django backend (e.g., via `"proxy": "http://localhost:8000"` in React's `package.json`) for seamless API calls during development.

---

## Serving React with Django

- After running `npm run build`, React's static files will be output into `backend/assets`.
- Django `settings.py` is configured to serve these static files as follow into settings.py:

```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'frontend'),
]
```

The app Home is used to set React as TemplateView routing, this is the home\views.py:

```python
class React(TemplateView):
    """A view that renders the React frontend"""
    template_name = 'index.html'
```

Then this is loaded into app\urls.py as:
```python
from home.views import React

urlpatterns = [
    ...,
    re_path(r'^.*', React.as_view(), name='frontend'),  
]

```

## Next Steps & Enhancements
Hit star button if you want also me to:
- Integrate **Django-Ninja** for API creation.
- Add **JWT authentication** for secure API access.
- Implement React global state management;
